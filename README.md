# Complex
Complex number class with methods.
This code includes some custom exception handling and also a Cis class which is short for cos(a) + isin(a) (a is an angle) working with degrees.
Additionally,I added a function to solve the basic equation z^n=x which returns a list of the solutions.that can be a little helpfull.
In this code the addtion/substarcion/multiplication and true division is made with the magic methods so it will be more easy to work with.
NOTE: It is valid to add/multiply/sub/divide a Complex instance with an int or a float but not with Cis instance.I did NOT fix the Cis class to work with it too.
